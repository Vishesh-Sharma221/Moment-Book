# Aim and Objective

The main aim of the Moment Book is to create a database for the users where every bit of information related to events that happened in the past ,present or future will be saved. This allows users to be more precise with every moment in their life.

The whole objective of this program is to get the event name with a particular date, that information will then be stored in a database which we can access later on to do stuff like :

- Accessing the data at any time in future.
- Sorting the data.
- Updating the data at any time.
- Deleting records from the data as well

## Installation

```py
pip install Moment-Book
```

Install the terminal version (the lastest one at the moment) of this project using pip.
The comman above should work properly but in case one does not you can try these:

> pip install Moment-Book <br/>
> python3 -m pip install Moment-Book <br/>
> python3.9 -m pip install Moment-Book

## Running the CLI

After the package is successfully installed in your respective machine, you can run the command line interface or CLI using this command :

```py
python3.9 -m MomentBook.cli
```

> Note: I'm being more specific with `python3.9` as i have multiple versions of python on my linux machine but if you don't you can just simply go with `python -m MomentBook.cli`
